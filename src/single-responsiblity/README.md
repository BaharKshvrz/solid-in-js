# Single Responsiblity Principle
    Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:
    A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

Example: In CalorieTracker class, there are 2 reasons to change:
first, changing the amount of calories and second, logging the message.
