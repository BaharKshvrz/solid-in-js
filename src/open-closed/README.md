# Opend/Closed Principle

Open/Closed principle promotes the use of protocols to enable you to adapt the functionality of your application without changing the existing code.

“Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”
This is such an entity can allow it’s behaviour to be changed without altering it’s source code.
