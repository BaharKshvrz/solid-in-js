# Interface Segregation Principle

In the field of software engineering, the interface segregation principle (ISP) states that no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

In this example "Turret" doent need "move" method.
The principle tells us we should use all the methods of Interface.
